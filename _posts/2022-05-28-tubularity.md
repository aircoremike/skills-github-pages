This blog post is a play on the words "tubular" as in a vintage word meaning "cool" in 80's Califorinia surf lingo, and "singularity." The intention is to define the mindstate while getting barreled while surfing. It can only be described as a oneness with the wave and therefore with nature.
While inside a the tube of a wave, a surfer must concentrate entirely on the water around them and their balance on it. The tube obstructs everything in the periphery. Behind the surfer there is only water and in front of them there is only escape.
